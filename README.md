Use this command in the root directory (where docker-compose.yml is) to build and run the app via Docker:

```
docker compose up -d
```

The app will be exposed on localhost on port 8000.

The Postman collection for the APIs in this project is included in the repo, and it assumes you are running the backend on localhost on port 8000.
